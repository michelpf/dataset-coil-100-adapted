# Columbia University Image Library (COIL-100)

This dataset was originally downloaded from Columbia Univeristy then organized into separated directories refering to the 100 classes (Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-100),"
S. A. Nene, S. K. Nayar and H. Murase, Technical Report CUCS-006-96, February 1996.). Each class was named to the appropriate representation of the objetcs.
The goal of this repository is to facilitate the teaching of deep learning classes with organized data.

Please, refer the full dataset at [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-100.php).

This dataset was adapted to use in Machine Learning classes. The generated output image removed and the directory structure was changed.
